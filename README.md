# Homework for course of Prof. Ferreira
The repository consists of two files:
* ```parking-violations-small.csv``` Cleaned data of New York City parking violations
* ```trees.ipynb``` iPython Notebook for analysis of dependnece of New York trees on shadows

## Findings about trees and sun (shadows) amount in New York City
Those findings were made using that notebook.

### Can you find a correlation between the amount of sun and tree health?
* There is no correlation between tree health and sun (shadow) amount on the item level
* However, if using aggregated view, there is a negative correlation between tree health and sun amount (e.g. Pearson Correlation for sun amount in winter = -0.47, alpha = 0.01)

### Is tree height associated with health? Do taller trees get more sun?

### How prevalent are species that tolerate shade? Are trees of these species healthier? Have they been planted in suitable places, where they get plenty of shade?
